# Why is this empty?
Here should lie the splendour.cafe project but it currently lies in a private repository. That's kinda my first project that will openly face the public so for now I'm not so keen to make it open-source. The code quality is "it is what it is" and while I'm happy for acomplishing my goal I have some fears opening it's source code as of now. Hope you understand, cheers =).
